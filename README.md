# Incident Response & Review – IBM Clicked Mini Sprint

### Description
As part of this hands-on cybersecurity exercise, I took on the role of an incident response analyst, applying the NIST Incident Response Process Framework to a simulated security incident. Throughout this experience, I:

  * Developed an incident response timeline and remediation plan, identifying Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) and assessing threat impact.
  * Conducted technical analysis of attack vectors and implemented containment strategies following best practices.
  * Led a post-incident briefing, presenting key findings, response actions, and lessons learned to stakeholders.
  * Strengthened my ability to communicate complex cybersecurity issues effectively to both technical and non-technical audiences.

This project enhanced my incident handling skills, allowing me to refine threat mitigation strategies, forensic analysis techniques, and stakeholder communication—critical elements in effective cybersecurity operations.
