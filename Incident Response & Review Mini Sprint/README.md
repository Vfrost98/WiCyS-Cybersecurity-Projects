# Incident Response & Review – IBM Clicked Mini Sprint

### Description
As part of this hands-on cybersecurity exercise, I took on the role of an incident response analyst, applying the NIST Incident Response Process Framework to a simulated security incident. Throughout this experience, I:

  * Developed an incident response timeline and remediation plan, identifying Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) and assessing threat impact.
  * Conducted technical analysis of attack vectors and implemented containment strategies following best practices.
  * Led a post-incident briefing, presenting key findings, response actions, and lessons learned to stakeholders.
  * Strengthened my ability to communicate complex cybersecurity issues effectively to both technical and non-technical audiences.

This project enhanced my incident handling skills, allowing me to refine threat mitigation strategies, forensic analysis techniques, and stakeholder communication—critical elements in effective cybersecurity operations.

### Scenario - Unusual Activity
You've been hired to come in as a security analyst on a team working for X Clinic. X Clinic, a file transfer platform, recently flagged some unusual network activity that has raised alarms. The senior management is taking this incident very seriously, given the medical data contained on the network. As a security analyst for X Clinic, your task is to identify the nature of this alert, its potential impact, suggest mitigation strategies, and compile a review. You will be working closely with the CTO to complete this project.
